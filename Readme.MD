Building on previous MarketWatchBETA. This is a live stock trading model which was inaugrated at the National Level Technical Fest, TechTatva Manipal, MIT. 

It is a state of the art web application that users log in to NYSE and invest in real time stocks, see the stock change and make smart decisions on their initial purse which was 100,000$. 

THe web application was developed solely by Aman Singh Thakur on Flask framework using Full Stack development, software engineering, web development, DBMS, data mining and UI and UX. Being one of the popular and complex projects, The WallStreet was one of the biggest events at the techfest garnering over 500 people in 3 days time (Refer Screenshots). 

The live stock changes were fed live from Yahoo finance and the top 25 companies of New York Stock Exchange were open for trade. Using software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms, the stocks were fetch live for all 25 companies with zero latency which was in itself a huge accomplishment and was later much appreciated. The website was very sticky, versatile and mobile compatible too.

This project has been open sources because I want to integrate machine learning models such as SVM,etc and AI models such as sentiment analysis to make a completely free international live stock trading website.
